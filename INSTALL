IMPORTANT: This version is NOT a module for Moodle. 
This conception has changed. It has happened to be a 
module to be an integral system of internal mail.

If you're installed Email module, before you uninstall it, after you can
install eMail integration.

Only install on versions >= 1.7.

BBDD suported has MySQL and Postgressql


Here is a basic outline of the installation process, 
which normally takes me only a few seconds:

1) Copy "email" to root moodle folder, "moodle/email"

2) Copy files language in it's corresponding folder.
"lang/en/email.php" in "moodle/lang/en/", and for example
 "lang/ca_utf8" in "moodledata/lang/ca_utf8".

3) Copy block of mail information ("block/email_list") in corresponding
folder "moodle/blocks/".

4) Click on Notifications link (Administration Block) for install. In this moment

if the bbdd structure not created, it has been created.

For bugs, please contact with Toni Mas (toni.mas@uib.es), thanks.
